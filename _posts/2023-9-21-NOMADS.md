NOMADS (Navy Operational Machine Auditing Development Suite) was my team's capstone project sponsored by the US Navy's NACWD (Navy Air Warfare Center Weapons Division).  It is a piece of software that, once installed, finds all other devices on the current network and attempts to log into them using given credentials.  It will then log all relevant device and program information to create a network topology graph.  Importantly, it is a platform for running software on each of those devices, which may include searching for known vulnerabilities or running NOMADS itself, allowing it to audit an entire airgapped network space for which it has been given authority to access.  It won third place at the UCSB CS Summit in 2021.

Surprisingly, the hardest part wasn't the auditing stuff, but visually displaying it.  I reverse engineered Draw.io's xml format to programmatically generate the network graphs.  Drawing those rectangles and arrows by region took a lot of pixel math.
