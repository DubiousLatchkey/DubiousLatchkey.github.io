GlassDrive was the project for the first ever hackathon I was a part of: HakD.  Basically, the idea was we took a Raspberry Pi Zero and made it host an ad-hoc wifi network.  You could connect to it and use it as a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device.  It also had an front end to make it easier to download from.  It was called Glassdrive because the Raspberry Pi Zero was small enough to (in theory) be hooked up to a pair of glasses for wireless file transfer between any device.

I don't have any pictures left from the event, but we ended up winning.  Here's the <a href="https://github.com/DubiousLatchkey/GlassDrive">repo</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jmPqJWfpy4Vwv8mXC_9CL_Uz1jTh0oOiqBDCjhPL5H4/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a> from it though.
