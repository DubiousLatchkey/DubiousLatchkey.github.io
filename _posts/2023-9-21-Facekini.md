When I was at my internship at Bytedance, we had an internal hackathon.  Our team built this thing called Facekini which could basically take any properly formatted psd file and turn it into a vtuber setup.  Obviously it wasn't going to have all sorts of fancy live2d artistic flair, but it could do enough to add the underlying emotion to basically anything resembling a face.  Just take an image an cut out the eyes and mouth, and you too can use your webcam to be an anime girl online.  We had this setup where it outputted to an OBS camera, so when we went to present it (it was virtual since it was the pandemic), we all went in piloting different faces in the video call.

It was 2 rounds, and while we made the cut for the final presentation, we had not gotten first place in our preliminary round.  However, the judges were different for the final round, and they really liked it, earning us the win.  Unfortunately, the videos from that time were on my work computer which I gave back, so I can't show it off.
