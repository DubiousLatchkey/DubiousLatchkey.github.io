I've always wanted to get a smartwatch to make unique looking watch faces.  However, in order to do anything remotely non-standard, you have to code it yourself.  I made a watchface called Time featuring the Hugo Award winning story by Randall Munroe.  You can view the final panel <a href="https://xkcd.com/1190/">here</a>, but you'll need to look up an archive to see any of the other panels.  The panel the page led to changed every 30 minutes to an hour telling a 3000 panel story about a distant time.  In fact, figuring out what time period the comic occured in was key to understanding what it was depicting: the refilling of the Mediterranean after it dries up.

I took every image from the story and pngcrushed them down to as small as possible and tell the story on my watch every day with each frame given a 28 second window where it is the background image on the watchface.  It had been a while since I did Android development (read 6 years) so I had to relearn everything, this time in Kotlin.
