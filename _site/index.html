    <h2><a href="/2023/09/21/glassdrive.html" class="titleLink">GlassDrive</a></h2>
    <p>GlassDrive was the project for the first ever hackathon I was a part of: HakD.  Basically, the idea was we took a Raspberry Pi Zero and made it host an ad-hoc wifi network.  You could connect to it and use it as a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device.  It also had an front end to make it easier to download from.  It was called Glassdrive because the Raspberry Pi Zero was small enough to (in theory) be hooked up to a pair of glasses for wireless file transfer between any device.</p>

<p>I don’t have any pictures left from the event, but we ended up winning.  Here’s the <a href="https://github.com/DubiousLatchkey/GlassDrive">repo</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jmPqJWfpy4Vwv8mXC_9CL_Uz1jTh0oOiqBDCjhPL5H4/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a> from it though.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2023/09/21/acapella.html" class="titleLink">Acapella</a></h2>
    <p>Acapella was my team’s project for SB Hacks 2023 where it won second place.  It is a Minecraft mod made in <a href="https://fabricmc.net/">Fabric</a> that add a command to beat the game autonomously.  It uses <a href="https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone">Baritone</a> to do pathfinding.  Check out the Devpost page <a href="https://devpost.com/software/acapella">here</a>!</p>

<p>Basically it uses a stack of tasks we made and pops those tasks off in order of dependency.  Each task may generate additional subtasks and the idea is that each task is easy enough to solve using Baritone and some manually coded behaviors.  It also automatically defends itself and maintains its hunger.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2023/09/21/NOMADS.html" class="titleLink">NOMADS</a></h2>
    <p>NOMADS (Navy Operational Machine Auditing Development Suite) was my team’s capstone project sponsored by the US Navy’s NACWD (Navy Air Warfare Center Weapons Division).  It is a piece of software that, once installed, finds all other devices on the current network and attempts to log into them using given credentials.  It will then log all relevant device and program information to create a network topology graph.  Importantly, it is a platform for running software on each of those devices, which may include searching for known vulnerabilities or running NOMADS itself, allowing it to audit an entire airgapped network space for which it has been given authority to access.  It won third place at the UCSB CS Summit in 2021.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the hardest part wasn’t the auditing stuff, but visually displaying it.  I reverse engineered Draw.io’s xml format to programmatically generate the network graphs.  Drawing those rectangles and arrows by region took a lot of pixel math.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2023/09/21/Monumental.html" class="titleLink">Monumental</a></h2>
    <p>Monumental was the hackathon project I worked on for SBHacks 2020.  It was all a way for our team to teach ourselves how to use Firebase to do a geo-caching setup.  The interface is a map much like Pokemon Go.  Here’s the <a href="https://github.com/DubiousLatchkey/monumentAndroid">repo</a>.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2023/09/21/Facekini.html" class="titleLink">Facekini</a></h2>
    <p>When I was at my internship at Bytedance, we had an internal hackathon.  Our team built this thing called Facekini which could basically take any properly formatted psd file and turn it into a vtuber setup.  Obviously it wasn’t going to have all sorts of fancy live2d artistic flair, but it could do enough to add the underlying emotion to basically anything resembling a face.  Just take an image an cut out the eyes and mouth, and you too can use your webcam to be an anime girl online.  We had this setup where it outputted to an OBS camera, so when we went to present it (it was virtual since it was the pandemic), we all went in piloting different faces in the video call.</p>

<p>It was 2 rounds, and while we made the cut for the final presentation, we had not gotten first place in our preliminary round.  However, the judges were different for the final round, and they really liked it, earning us the win.  Unfortunately, the videos from that time were on my work computer which I gave back, so I can’t show it off.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2023/09/21/Experiments-in-Watchfaces.html" class="titleLink">Time</a></h2>
    <p>I’ve always wanted to get a smartwatch to make unique looking watch faces.  However, in order to do anything remotely non-standard, you have to code it yourself.  I made a watchface called Time featuring the Hugo Award winning story by Randall Munroe.  You can view the final panel <a href="https://xkcd.com/1190/">here</a>, but you’ll need to look up an archive to see any of the other panels.  The panel the page led to changed every 30 minutes to an hour telling a 3000 panel story about a distant time.  In fact, figuring out what time period the comic occured in was key to understanding what it was depicting: the refilling of the Mediterranean after it dries up.</p>

<p>I took every image from the story and pngcrushed them down to as small as possible and tell the story on my watch every day with each frame given a 28 second window where it is the background image on the watchface.  It had been a while since I did Android development (read 6 years) so I had to relearn everything, this time in Kotlin.</p>
